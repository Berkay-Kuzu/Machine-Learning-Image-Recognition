# Machine-Learning-Image-Recognition
This is a machine learning app which recognizes the uploaded images. I benefited from MobileNetV2 machine learning which developed by Apple. When users select images from their library, the app identifies the name of their image and indicates the confidence level with percentage. Besides, I also used UIImagePickerController() to pick the images from the users' photolibrary. In deed, there are two ways of image recognition, request and handler. I requested the images and then handle them.
